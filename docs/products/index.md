# Telcofy Product Suite

Telcofy packages MultiMNO-derived analytics into commercial offerings designed for business and public-sector decision makers. Every dataset can split local SIMs from foreign roamers (with country-of-origin metadata). Local populations may be extrapolated using the originating operator’s market-share factors, whereas foreign roamers remain un-extrapolated because cross-operator coverage cannot be observed.

## Standardised Activity Stays

- **What it measures** — Sustained device presence based on staypoint detection (e.g. devices dwelling longer than 10 minutes).
- **Use cases** — Urban planning, retail footfall benchmarking, commercial real-estate evaluation, event and venue analysis.
- **Delivery** — Time-bucketed activity tables with duration bands, dwell counts, and optional segmentation by local vs. foreign SIMs.

## ODM: Origin–Destination Matrix

- **What it measures** — Movement flows between stay locations, capturing departures, arrivals, and trip volumes within configurable time windows.
- **Use cases** — Regional and long-distance transport planning, corridor optimisation, tourism flow analysis, infrastructure investment targeting.
- **Delivery** — Aggregated OD matrices with device counts, journey-time stats, and origin/destination attributes (including country for foreign SIMs).

## Telcofy Realtime

- **What it measures** — Low-latency snapshots of unique devices in a geography.
- **Use cases** — Operational monitoring, traffic and crowd management, emergency response, live event operations.
- **Delivery** — Streaming or frequent snapshots, surfaced via dashboards or APIs, with optional local vs. foreign breakdowns (non-extrapolated for roamers).
