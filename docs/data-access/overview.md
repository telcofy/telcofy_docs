# Analytics Overview

Telcofy offers several pathways to explore, export, and integrate telecom insights. Choose the delivery mechanism that best fits your workflow, whether you prefer file-based exploration, SQL-driven analysis, or near-real-time API calls.

## Storage-backed datasets

For teams that want direct file access, Telcofy curates data drops in familiar formats such as CSV, JSON, and Parquet. These assets are delivered through blob storage so you can pull them into notebooks, lakehouses, or existing ETL pipelines without additional tooling. See [API Reference](../api/quickstart.md) for more details

## BigQuery Analytical Hub

If you already rely on Google Cloud, Telcofy's BigQuery listings provide an interactive SQL experience with governed sharing. Start with the curated listings described in the [Analytical Hub guide](./analytical-hub.md) to join, filter, and enrich datasets using native BigQuery tooling.

## REST API

For API-first integrations and operational systems that require programmatic access, Telcofy exposes the same curated data sets through a REST interface. Follow the [REST API quickstart](../api/quickstart.md) to authenticate, browse resources, and embed Telcofy insights into your applications.
