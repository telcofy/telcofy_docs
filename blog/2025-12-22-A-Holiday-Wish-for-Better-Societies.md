# From Momentum to Impact: A Holiday Wish for Better Societies

As the holidays approach, it is natural to look back at the path we’ve traveled. For Telcofy, 2025 wasn’t just a year of business development; it was a year of initiative, conception, and birth.

By this time last year, Telcofy was just a bold idea pitched by Tom Henriksen days before Christmas—a vision to leave the safety of established corporate roles and go "all in" on a new venture. Today, looking at what we have built, we are moving from momentum to genuine impact, driven by one clear ambition: to help societies make better decisions using high quality, trustworthy, privacy-first human mobility insight.

## Why We Took the Leap

We didn't just start a company to sell data. We started Telcofy because we saw that mobility analytics had to evolve. Too many solutions are bogged down by high costs, slow innovation cycles, and complex compliance hurdles.

David and Alexey joined this mission with a vision to build a service that was "better, more sustainable, and smarter" than what was previously possible. Instead of reinventing the wheel for every project, we focused on a standardized, iterative friendly, effective,scalable pipeline that puts privacy-by-design first and only processed data on demand.

## The Ball Never Stopped Rolling

As any founder knows, startup life is rarely a straight line. We learned quickly that everything takes longer than we would like. But throughout 2025, even when we faced delays, the ball never once stopped rolling.

Our development team, led by Alexey and David, didn’t wait for data access either. They used every moment to build a platform aligned with emerging EU and Eurostat frameworks and first hand knowledge about market needs. The sheer number of Trello updates from our scrum team remains the only thing on my phone that rivals my daughter’s Snapchat pings!

We also learned that timing is everything. While discussions with Telia have been shaped by their internal timing considerations, we appreciate the constructive dialogue and their positive view of our vision. We look forward to continued engagement when the timing aligns.

## A Community of Believers

None of this happens in isolation. Progress is built on collaboration, and we want to send a massive holiday thank you to the ecosystem that helped keep our momentum going:

- The Foundation: A huge thank you to the Telpoint team, Bjørn-Sverre, and our chair Aleksander, who challenges us every week. A special shout-out to Jan Frode, whose patience and blank A4 papers helped turn a rough idea into an investor-ready reality.
- The Telco Partners: We are grateful for the support from Berit Svendsen—whose passion for innovation helped open the right doors—and to Brage and Njål at Telenor for helping us build trust and momentum step by step. Internationally, we are excited by the progress with Elisa in Estonia, upcoming meetings with BT, and constructive discussions with KPN regarding the Dutch market.
- Innovation & Validation: Thank you to Osman Ibrahim in Oslo BER and Smart Oslo Thomas Bergøy Johansen and Thea Pope for the innovation grant project that framed our approach , and to our partners at SSB, TØI, and Høyskolen Kristiania for ensuring our work is grounded in robust methodology.
- Expanding Horizons: Through Proventia, Nordic Edge, ITS Norway, and DMI, we are connecting with relevant companies across Europe
- All the potential partners downstream who have sparred with us and encouraged this Journey every step of the way!

## Our Wish for 2026

What stands out most from 2025 is the support, curiosity, and willingness to collaborate we've encountered. The demand for better mobility insight is real, and the momentum is growing.

For 2026, our wish is simple: For those who wish for better societies—let’s together make that wish come true.

We are energized by what lies ahead. We are laying the groundwork for mobility analytics that truly serve the public good, moving away from bespoke, expensive projects toward an open, interoperable future.

To all our partners, friends, and future collaborators: Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
