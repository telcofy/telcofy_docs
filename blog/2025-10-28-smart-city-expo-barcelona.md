# Telcofy at Smart City Expo Barcelona 2025: Human Mobility for Smarter Cities


With Telcofy's vision of creating better and more sustainable societies, attending Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona this November is a natural step.

Smart cities depend on understanding how people move and the effect initiatives have on human mobility ‚Äî the mobility insight is the foundation for everything from transportation planning and urban development to event logistics, retail analytics, and increasingly, emergency preparedness and response.

## Why Human Mobility Matters for Smart Cities

Cities are living systems. Understanding how citizens, commuters, and visitors move through them allows us to design more connected, efficient, and resilient environments.

Telcofy enables cities, research institutes, and telecom operators to transform mobile network data (MNO data) into actionable human mobility analytics that support both public-sector planning and sustainable innovation.

### Real-world use cases

- **Transport & infrastructure:** Optimize routes, capacity, and urban design based on real mobility flows.
- **Tourism & retail:** Understand visitor dynamics and support sustainable business development.
- **Event & crowd management:** Use anonymized data to ensure safety and efficient resource allocation.
- **Emergency response:** Analyze movement patterns during crises to improve evacuation planning and response strategies.

Mobility data from MNOs alone rarely tells the whole story. The greatest value emerges when it is enriched and connected with other data ‚Äî from IoT sensors, ticketing systems, public datasets, weather, transactional and satellite sources.

That is why collaboration, interoperability, and privacy-by-design are at the core of Telcofy's approach.

## Building the Data Infrastructure for Smarter Cities

Telcofy is building an open, transparent, and compliant data pipeline designed to connect multi-operator mobility data with European data spaces and smart-city ecosystems.

We believe the future of urban mobility insight depends on strong cooperation between operators, cities, research institutions, and technology partners ‚Äî all working within shared standards and governance frameworks.

This is why we're excited to connect with the DMI Ecosystem in the Netherlands and with innovative partners like Scenexus, who share our commitment to open collaboration and responsible data innovation for smarter, more sustainable cities.

## Nordic Collaboration and Smart Oslo

We're proud to be part of the Nordic Edge program in Barcelona, showcasing Nordic innovation in smart city development.

Together with the City of Oslo and their Department of Emergency Management, Telcofy is exploring how mobility analytics can improve both daily urban operations and emergency preparedness, through the Smart Oslo Fund initiative.

This collaboration highlights how mobility data can serve as an essential decision-support tool for cities working to enhance resilience, sustainability, and citizen well-being.

## Let's Meet in Barcelona!

The Smart City Expo World Congress is one of the most inspiring global meeting grounds for urban innovation ‚Äî and we can't wait to connect with city leaders, researchers, and innovators who share our passion for data-driven transformation.

If what Telcofy is building resonates with you, let's meet in Barcelona!

And if you're an "old friend" or partner we didn't know would be there, please reach out ‚Äî we'd love to catch up at the Expo.
